  - node-postgres/.gitignore
  - mern-starter/.gitignore
  - stripe-integration/.gitignore
  - docker-node/.gitignore
  - crm-platform/.gitignore
  - ecommerce-platform/.gitignore
- All .gitignore files include appropriate patterns for:
  - Node modules
  - Build outputs
  - Environment variables
  - Editor files
  - OS files
  - Logs and temporary files

#### 3. Environment Variable Templates Documented ✅
- Created `env-templates.md` in Memory-Bank with complete .env.example templates for all boilerplates
- Documented environment variables for:
  - express-api
  - nextjs-starter
  - node-postgres
  - stripe-integration
  - mern-starter (client and server)
  - crm-platform (client and server)
  - ecommerce-platform (client and server)
  - docker-node
  - react-vite
- Note: .env.example files are blocked from automatic creation but templates are documented for manual creation

#### 4. Package.json Verification ✅
- Verified all package.json files are complete and consistent
- All root package.json files for full-stack projects include:
  - Concurrent development scripts
  - Install scripts for client and server
  - Build and start scripts
  - Linting and testing scripts
  - Type checking scripts
- Package.json files include proper metadata (name, version, description, keywords, license)

#### 5. Configuration Files Verification ✅
- Verified all TypeScript projects have tsconfig.json files (11 found)
- Verified all Vite projects have vite.config.ts files (4 found)
- Verified all Tailwind projects have tailwind.config.js files
- All configuration files are present and properly structured

### Completed Improvements Summary
1. ✅ Memory-Bank documentation structure created
2. ✅ .gitignore files added to all 12 boilerplates
3. ✅ Environment variable templates documented in env-templates.md
4. ✅ Package.json files verified as complete and consistent
5. ✅ Configuration files verified (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)

### Next Steps
- Create .env.example files manually using templates in Memory-Bank/env-templates.md
- Run validation tests (simple-test.sh) to confirm all improvements
- Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage
