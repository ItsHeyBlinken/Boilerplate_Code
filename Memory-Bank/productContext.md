# Product Context: Boilerplate Library

## Why This Project Exists
Starting a new project involves significant repetitive setup work: configuring build tools, setting up authentication, creating folder structures, and implementing common patterns. This boilerplate library eliminates that friction by providing ready-to-use starting points.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Setup Time**: Reduces project initialization from hours to minutes
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all projects start with proven patterns
3. **Best Practices**: Embeds modern development practices from day one
4. **Learning**: Provides examples of how to structure different types of applications
5. **Quality**: Pre-validated code reduces initial bugs and technical debt

## How It Should Work
1. **Selection**: Developer browses available boilerplates
2. **Copy**: Developer copies desired boilerplate to new project location
3. **Configure**: Developer sets up environment variables and dependencies
4. **Customize**: Developer adds unique features on top of the foundation
5. **Deploy**: Developer deploys with confidence in the base structure

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Clear documentation makes it obvious what each boilerplate provides
- **Simplicity**: Copy and run - minimal configuration required
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize without fighting the boilerplate structure
- **Reliability**: Tested and validated code that works out of the box
- **Maintainability**: Well-organized code that's easy to understand and modify

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Quick Prototyping**: Start a new project idea quickly
2. **Team Onboarding**: New team members can start with proven structure
3. **Learning**: Developers learn patterns by studying working examples
4. **Standardization**: Organizations standardize project structures

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Code Reference**: Use as reference for implementing specific features
2. **Testing**: Validate new tools or patterns in isolated boilerplates
3. **Teaching**: Educational resource for development courses
4. **Comparison**: Compare different approaches to similar problems

## Success Metrics
- Number of boilerplates maintained (target: 12+)
- Test pass rate (target: 100%)
- Documentation completeness (target: 100%)
- User feedback and adoption
- Consistency across boilerplates
