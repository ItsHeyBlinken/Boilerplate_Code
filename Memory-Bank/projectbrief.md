# Project Brief: Boilerplate Library

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of production-ready boilerplate code for different project types. This library provides GitHub-ready starting points that save developers time when initiating new projects.

## Core Purpose
- **Time Savings**: Eliminate repetitive setup work for common project types
- **Best Practices**: Provide battle-tested code following modern development standards
- **Production Ready**: All boilerplates are ready for immediate use and deployment
- **Educational**: Serve as learning resources for modern development patterns

## Project Goals
1. Maintain a collection of 12+ production-ready boilerplates
2. Ensure all boilerplates follow consistent patterns and standards
3. Provide comprehensive documentation for each boilerplate
4. Include testing infrastructure to validate boilerplate quality
5. Support multiple technology stacks (React, Next.js, Express, etc.)

## Target Users
- Developers starting new projects
- Teams needing quick project scaffolding
- Developers learning modern development patterns
- Organizations standardizing project structures

## Success Criteria
- All boilerplates are functional and tested
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- Boilerplates follow consistent patterns
- Easy to copy and customize for new projects
- Regular updates with latest dependencies and best practices

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Frontend boilerplates (React, Next.js, static HTML)
  - Backend boilerplates (Express, Node.js)
  - Full-stack boilerplates (MERN, CRM, E-commerce)
  - Infrastructure boilerplates (Docker, deployment)
  - Testing and validation tools
  
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Hosting or deployment services
  - Custom development for specific clients
  - Long-term maintenance of projects built from boilerplates

## Key Principles
1. **Consistency**: All boilerplates follow similar structure and patterns
2. **Modern Stack**: Use current, well-supported technologies
3. **Type Safety**: Prefer TypeScript where applicable
4. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive README files for each boilerplate
5. **Testing**: Include testing infrastructure where appropriate
6. **Security**: Follow security best practices (JWT, password hashing, etc.)
