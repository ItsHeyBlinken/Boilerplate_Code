# 🧪 Boilerplate Testing Guide

This guide provides multiple approaches to test your boilerplate projects without installing all dependencies locally.

## 🎯 Testing Approaches

### 1. **Simple Structure Testing** (No Dependencies Required)
- Tests file structure, package.json validity, and basic configuration
- Works without Docker or Node.js installation
- Good for quick validation

### 2. **Docker-Based Testing** (Recommended)
- Tests actual build and functionality
- Uses isolated containers
- Requires Docker installation
- Most comprehensive testing

### 3. **Manual Testing** (For Specific Projects)
- Test individual projects as needed
- Use online tools and services
- Good for debugging specific issues

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple Testing (No Dependencies)
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x simple-test.sh

# Run simple tests
./simple-test.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker-Based Testing (Comprehensive)
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test-boilerplates.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./test-boilerplates.sh
```

## 📋 What Each Test Checks

### Static HTML Projects
- ✅ HTML file exists and is readable
- ✅ Valid HTML5 structure
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript files present
- ✅ README documentation exists

### Node.js Projects
- ✅ package.json exists and is valid JSON
- ✅ Required fields (name, version, scripts)
- ✅ TypeScript configuration (if applicable)
- ✅ Docker build capability
- ✅ Project structure completeness

### React/Vite Projects
- ✅ Vite configuration
- ✅ React dependencies
- ✅ Build process validation
- ✅ Development server capability

### Full-Stack Projects
- ✅ Server-side package.json
- ✅ Client-side package.json
- ✅ Database configuration
- ✅ Environment variables setup

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### For Simple Testing
- Bash shell
- Basic Unix tools (grep, find)
- Optional: `jq` for JSON validation

### For Docker Testing
- Docker installed and running
- Docker daemon accessible
- Sufficient disk space for images

## 📊 Test Results Interpretation

### ✅ PASS
- Project structure is correct
- Configuration files are valid
- Build process works
- All dependencies resolve

### ⚠️ WARNING
- Minor issues found
- Missing optional files
- Non-critical configuration problems

### ❌ FAIL
- Critical issues found
- Invalid configuration
- Build failures
- Missing required files

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Docker Issues
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker info

# If Docker daemon not running
sudo systemctl start docker  # Linux
# or start Docker Desktop     # Windows/Mac
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run with proper permissions
sudo ./test-boilerplates.sh  # if needed
```

### Path Issues
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
pwd
ls -la boilerplate-library/
```

## 🎯 Testing Individual Projects

### Test a Single Static Project
```bash
# Open HTML file in browser
open boilerplate-library/html-css-js/index.html
```

### Test a Single Node.js Project
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd boilerplate-library/express-api

# Check package.json
cat package.json | jq .

# Test with Docker (if available)
docker build -t test-express .
```

### Test a Single React Project
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd boilerplate-library/react-vite

# Check configuration
cat package.json | jq .scripts
cat vite.config.ts  # if exists
```

## 📈 Advanced Testing Options

### 1. **Online Testing Services**
- **CodePen**: Test HTML/CSS/JS projects
- **StackBlitz**: Test Node.js/React projects
- **Replit**: Test full-stack projects
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Test in cloud environment

### 2. **CI/CD Testing**
- Set up GitHub Actions
- Automated testing on every commit
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### 3. **Performance Testing**
- Lighthouse audits for web projects
- Bundle size analysis for React projects
- Load testing for API projects

## 🔍 Manual Verification Checklist

### For Each Project, Verify:
- [ ] README.md exists and is informative
- [ ] package.json is valid and complete
- [ ] All required files are present
- [ ] Configuration files are valid
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] Build process works
- [ ] Development server starts
- [ ] Production build succeeds

### For Full-Stack Projects, Also Check:
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] API endpoints are functional
- [ ] Client-server communication works
- [ ] Authentication flow is complete

## 📝 Test Report Template

After running tests, document your findings:

```markdown
# Test Report - [Date]

## Summary
- Total Projects: X
- Passed: X
- Failed: X
- Warnings: X

## Detailed Results

### ✅ Working Projects
- Project Name: Status and notes

### ❌ Failed Projects
- Project Name: Issue description and fix

### ⚠️ Projects with Warnings
- Project Name: Warning description

## Recommendations
- Action items for fixing issues
- Improvements for project structure
- Documentation updates needed
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

A boilerplate project is considered "working" when:
1. ✅ All required files are present
2. ✅ Configuration is valid
3. ✅ Dependencies can be installed
4. ✅ Build process succeeds
5. ✅ Development server starts
6. ✅ Basic functionality works
7. ✅ Documentation is complete

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review individual project README files
3. Check Docker logs for build errors
4. Verify file permissions and paths
5. Ensure all prerequisites are installed
